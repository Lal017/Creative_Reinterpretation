                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we think of a monster, we often imagine something non-human, ugly, and dangerous. However, the Green Knight challenges that idea. He has some monstrous qualities but also human traits, making him a mix of both. This makes us question what really defines a monster, is it how someone looks, how they act, or the effect they have on others?</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Green Knight first appears, he shocks everyone at the New Year's celebration. His appearance is a big reason why the knights are so afraid of him. The Green Knight's bright green color makes him stand out as strange and unfamiliar. Green is a natural color we see in everyday life in trees and plants, but it can also represent danger, like in poisonous plants or poison in general is often depicted as green. This mix of life and danger in the color green makes the Green Knight seem unpredictable. The knights are unsure whether he is friendly or a threat, which adds to their fear.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important feature of the Green Knight is his size. He is described as the biggest man anyone has ever seen. This immediately makes him intimidating because his strength and power seem greater than that of a normal human. When he enters the room, he takes control without even trying. Even though King Arthur is there, all attention shifts to the Green Knight. What makes the Green Knight especially interesting is that he is not ugly or monstrous in the traditional sense. He is described as well-dressed and handsome. This breaks the usual idea that monsters have to be hideous or inhuman-looking. The Green Knight's appearance shows that being monstrous is not just about looks but also about what someone does or represents.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he is first introduced, he is much more of a barbarian with his actions. Claiming he could beat any of the knights in a duel if he wanted to, smashing through the door of a party uninvited and challenging the knights to a dangerous game. However, at the end of the story when we see him again, he feels much more sophisticated, like a traditional knight should be. He is the lord of a castle with a lady of his own, he spares Sir Gawain before chopping his head off to teach him a lesson about his cowardice. For this reason, I decided to refer to the Green Knight as the Green Horseman in part I of my short translation and as the Green Knight in part IV of the story later on.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the Green Knight shows us that a monster is not just a non-human creature. A monster can be anyone or anything that is unfamiliar, powerful, and unsettling. The Green Knight's strange color, huge size, and role in testing Gawain's character all combine to make him a monster. However, his human traits, like his handsome appearance, show that being a monster does not mean someone has to be completely separate from humanity. Instead, monsters are defined by how they make us feel and how they challenge us, and the Green Knight does exactly that.</p>
