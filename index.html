                    <h3>The Green Horseman</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights of the round table, the most feared and honorable knights in the land celebrate along with king Arthur and his wife Queen Guinevere. Among these knights is the Honorable Sir Gawain, nephew to King Arthur. The knights exchange gifts and share their own adventurous stories with each other.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a perilous horseman the size of half a troll burst through the front doors. The knights, along with King Arthur, are astonished at the size of the man. After viewing the man for but a moment they declare him to be the largest man alive. The man has a distinguishing feature about him, for all his clothes are green, his horse is green, his skin green. The green horseman carried with him an axe that unsurprisingly was green.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green horseman declares to the knights that he is not looking for trouble, and that even if he was there for trouble, it wouldn't matter because none of the knights at the round table could match his might. Instead, he wants to play a game with them. He explains to them the rules of the game, for whoever chooses to volunteer will strike one blow to him with the axe in his hand. However, in return he is allowed to strike one blow back to them in exactly one year and one day from now.</p>

                    <h3>Sir Gawain</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights are reluctant to accept, and everyone hesitates to volunteer. The Green Horseman angrily insults the knights calling them cowards for not volunteering. With his courage in question, King Arthur accepts the challenge of the Green Horseman and volunteers. However, eager to prove himself worthy and for the good of the king, Sir Gawain steps forward and asks King Arthur to allow him to take on the challenge instead. He convinces King Arthur and takes the axe. Sir Gawain, with one strike, beheads the Green Horseman with the axe.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Horseman, entirely unphased by this, walks over to his severed head and picks it up. He turns to Sir Gawain and tells him to meet him at the Green Chapel in one year on New Year's morning. The Green Horseman rides off leaving everyone in shock. The King, although impressed by the Green Horseman, did not let it show and kept his composure. This helped calm Queen Guinevere as he passed on this event as merely a Christmas game.</p>

                    <h3>Journey to the Green Chapel</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the seasons change and months go by, Sir Gawain thinks about his upcoming journey and its inevitability. King Arthur hosts a feast in Sir Gawain's honor. The knights of the round table are concerned for him, as they know how dangerous a journey this will be. Sir Gawain faces his duty head on and departs shortly after.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off on his journey in search of the green chapel, Sir Gawain encounters and battles many wild beasts, from wolves to wood trolls and ogres. After these tough battles, he encounters a beautiful castle and decides to enter it. He meets the lord of the castle who is a tall and dignified man who welcomes Sir Gawain with great hospitality. He also meets the lady of the castle as well as an old woman who she is accompanied by.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Gawain informs the lord of the castle that he must continue his journey to find the green chapel. The lord of the castle asks him to stay a few days longer because the green chapel was only about two miles away, so he should stay and enjoy their hospitality a little longer. Sir Gawain accepts the offer and stays for the following three days. The lord of the castle then makes Sir Gawain a proposal. Being a big fan of hunting, he tells Gawain that every day he goes out hunting, he would give him whatever he catches. In return, Sir Gawain needed to give him whatever he gained in the castle while he was gone. Sir Gawain accepts the offer and the following morning, the lord sets out on his hunt.</p>

                    <h3>The Lady of the Castle</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord sets off on his exhilarating hunt and enjoys himself to a great extent. Hunting a deer with chaotic movement, the lord hunts atop his horse with great skill. Meanwhile, back at the castle, the lady of the castle enters Sir Gawain's room while he is resting in bed. She proceeds to flirt with Sir Gawain, and to avoid offending the lady while also protecting his honor and virtue as a knight, he allows the lady one kiss in a courteous manner. When the lord returned from his hunt, he gives Sir Gawain venison from the deer he caught on his hunt. In return, Sir Gawain gives the lord a kiss, because this is what he gained while he was in the castle. The lord asks Sir Gawain who he received this kiss from, but he does not answer him as that is not part of their agreement.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day, the lord sets out hunting a fierce wild boar. Its a more dangerous hunt that takes great effort, but the lord eventually succeeds. Meanwhile, in the castle, the lady once again visits Sir Gawains room. She is bolder this time and tries harder to tempt him, yet Gawain continues to balance courtesy with restraint. The lady gives him two kisses, which Gawain again receives politely. That evening, the lord returns and presents Gawain with the boar he hunted. True to their agreement, Gawain gives him two kisses but, once more, keeps the source of the kisses secret. The lord laughs it off, respecting the terms of their deal.</p>

                    <h3>The Knights Deception</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, the lord hunts a fox, a tricky animal to capture, representing cunning and slyness. Back at the castle, the lady pays Gawain another visit, even more persistent in her advances. On this day, she gives three kisses and offers Gawain a gift: a green girdle. She tells him it is magical and will protect the wearer from harm or death. Initially, Gawain refuses, as knights are expected to avoid gifts that compromise their integrity. However, fearing his upcoming encounter with the Green Knight, he accepts the girdle but does not tell the lord about it, breaking their agreement for the first time. That night, the lord gives Gawain the fox pelt from his hunt, and Gawain gives the lord three kisses, but he keeps the green girdle secret.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following morning, Sir Gawain prepares to leave for the Green Chapel, guided by one of the lords servants. The guide warns Gawain about the dangerous Green Knight and advises him to flee instead of facing him. However, Gawain insists on honoring his promise. He reaches the eerie Green Chapel, a desolate and foreboding place, where the Green Knight awaits him.</p>

                    <h3>The Green Knight</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Knight raises his axe to deliver the blow. On the first swing, Gawain flinches, and the Green Knight mocks him for his lack of courage. On the second attempt, the Green Knight stops short to test Gawain's nerve. Finally, on the third swing, the Green Knight strikes Gawains neck, but only gives him a small nick, drawing a little blood.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Knight then reveals his true identity, Bertilak de Hautdesert, Lord of the castle, and that the entire challenge was a test orchestrated by Morgan le Fay, Arthurs sister, to test the honor of the knights of the Round Table. Bertilak explains that he spared Gawain because he remained mostly truthful, except for hiding the green girdle.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashamed of his small failure, Sir Gawain returns to King Arthurs court wearing the green girdle as a symbol of his sin and humility. He recounts his adventure to the court, openly confessing how he fell short of perfection by concealing the girdle in an effort to save his own life. The knights, however, respond not with reproach but with admiration for his bravery and honesty. In an unexpected turn, the knights of the Round Table choose to wear green sashes themselves as a gesture of unity and as a reminder of the frailty of human nature. The green girdle becomes a mark of solidarity, transforming Gawain's shame into a collective symbol that acknowledges both honor and imperfection.</p>
